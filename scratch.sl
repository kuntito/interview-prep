the idea is to generate a random number
that determine two operands and an operator that make up the number

start with the operator, 
if operator is addition or multiplication
    the random number cannot be prime

once, you have the number, write a function for each operator and number
the function should return two numbers that can combine to form the random number


the model should have a
    2d grid of numbers
    the unique positions of the numbers that make up the result
    the operator
    the result
