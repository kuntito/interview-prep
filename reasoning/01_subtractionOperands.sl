you'd want to select a random number, `dos`
increment it by a random amount, `uno`

you'd need ceilings for `dos`
you'd need ceilings for `uno`
you'd need ceilings for `amount`

the ceiling for `dos` is `80`
the ceiling for `random_amount` is `100 - dos`


for subtraction,
    between `2 and 80`, select a random number, `dos`
    between `1 and (100-dos)`
